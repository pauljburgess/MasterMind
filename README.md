### **Description**
In this game, the computer creates a secret code--a sequence of four colours in a row. The player then attempts to guess the correct colours in the correct order (doubles are not allowed). Each position in each guessed sequence is evaluated in one of three ways:
1. Correct colour in the correct position (marked Black)
2. Correct colour but in the wrong spot (marked White) 
3. The wrong colour altogether (no mark)

Depending on how many attempts it takes to guess the sequence, different funny messages will appear.
